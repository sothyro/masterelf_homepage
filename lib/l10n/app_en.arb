  "journeyPageHeadline": "My Endeavour",
  "journeyStory1": "Master Elf is a recognised practitioner of Feng Shui and Chinese Metaphysics, with a following of over 44,000 and a track record of guiding individuals and businesses toward clarity and results. His path did not begin by chance—it began with a calling.",
  "journeyStory2": "What started as a deep belief in the wisdom of the heavens grew into a mission: to bring ancient systems of timing, space and destiny into everyday life. Through years of study, practice and refinement, he built a method that turns metaphysics into actionable insight.",
  "journeyStory3": "Today, that method helps clients make better decisions, choose auspicious dates, understand their strengths and align their environments. From destiny readings to strategic date selection and Feng Shui audits, Master Elf's system is designed for real-world impact.",
  "journeyPeriod9Title": "Period 9 and the New Era",
  "journeyPeriod9Body": "We are now in Period 9 (2024–2043), the Li Fire era in the Xuan Kong Nine Periods cycle. This 20-year phase emphasises fire element energy, the south direction, and themes of visibility, progress and inner clarity. Master Elf's practice is aligned with this shift, helping you navigate the new era with timing and placement that match the cosmic cycle.",
  "journeyPhoenixTitle": "The Rise of the Phoenix",
  "journeyPhoenixBody": "The Rise of the Phoenix is Master Elf's revelation and the name of his system. It symbolises renewal, transformation and the moment when insight leads to action. In Period 9, the phoenix rises—and with the right knowledge, so can you. His framework integrates BaZi, Qimen Dunjia, I Ching, Date Selection, Feng Shui and Mao Shan into one coherent approach for those ready to rise.",
  "methodPageHeadline": "Our Method",
  "methodIntro": "Master Elf's system is built on classical Chinese metaphysics. Each discipline is applied with clear formulas and standards so that consultations and training are consistent, explainable and effective. Below is how the main pillars are practiced, calculated and used.",
  "methodBaZiTitle": "BaZi (Four Pillars of Destiny)",
  "methodBaZiBody": "BaZi uses your exact birth date and time to build four pillars—Year, Month, Day, Hour—each with a Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch (eight characters in total). The chart is calculated in true solar time where applicable. We analyse the Five Elements, strengths and clashes, and life cycles to reveal your potential, favourable directions and timing for key decisions.",
  "methodQimenTitle": "Qimen Dunjia",
  "methodQimenBody": "Qimen is built on a 3×3 Nine Palaces grid that changes with date and double-hour. We set the chart for the time of the question or event, place the Three Odd Stars (Yi, Bing, Ding), Eight Gates and Eight Deities, and interpret using Yin or Yang Dun. The formula is time-sensitive and used for strategy, date selection and situational analysis.",
  "methodIChingTitle": "I Ching (Book of Changes)",
  "methodIChingBody": "The I Ching is consulted to obtain a hexagram (six lines) that reflects the situation. We use the classical three-coin or yarrow-stalk method: each line is built from bottom to top (6 = transforming yin, 7 = stable yang, 8 = stable yin, 9 = transforming yang). The resulting hexagram and any changing lines are interpreted using the classic text and Master Elf's framework for decisions and direction.",
  "methodDateSelectionTitle": "Date Selection",
  "methodDateSelectionBody": "Auspicious dates and hours are chosen using the Chinese almanac (Tung Shu), BaZi compatibility with the event and principal, and Qimen Dunjia for strategic timing. We avoid inauspicious days (e.g. conflicting stems and branches) and align with favourable energies for openings, weddings, travel and major commitments.",
  "methodFengShuiTitle": "Feng Shui (Xuan Kong Flying Star)",
  "methodFengShuiBody": "We use Xuan Kong Fei Xing (Flying Star) Feng Shui. The building's period (based on completion year; the Feng Shui year starts 4 February) and facing direction (24 Mountains) determine the Flying Star chart. The nine palaces receive stars that combine with the Lo Shu layout. We assess mountain and water stars, element balance and Period 9 adjustments to recommend placement and remedies.",
  "methodMaoShanTitle": "Mao Shan",
  "methodMaoShanBody": "Mao Shan (Mount Mao) traditions are integrated where appropriate for ritual and practice within Master Elf's system. The methods are applied with respect to classical form and purpose, supporting both spiritual and practical dimensions of Chinese metaphysics as used in his framework.",
